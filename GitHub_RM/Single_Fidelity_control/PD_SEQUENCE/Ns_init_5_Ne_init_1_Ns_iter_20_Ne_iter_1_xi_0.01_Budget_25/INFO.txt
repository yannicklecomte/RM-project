================================
Number of episodes = 1
High-Fidelity training samples = 5
BO iteration = 20
Exploration param, xi = 0.01
Re-HPO frequency = 1
Cost function type = penalty
Alpha_p = 0.05, Alpha_d = 0.5
Domain boundaries = {bounds}
For training case 3 with quadratic penalty, large bounds and fitlered error value
