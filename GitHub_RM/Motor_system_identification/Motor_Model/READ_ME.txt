-------------- TEST OF THE MOTOR'S MODEL --------------

--- Description ----
- These test aims to verify the models established for the thrust and RPM predictions of the motor FPP.

- Warning: The coeffs to obtain the thrust/RPM from the power input (gamma) must be carefully chosen to correspond to the same input voltage.
